    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>App:</strong> VidX Files &nbsp;•&nbsp; <strong>Developer:</strong> Arti Mishra</p>
    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>By downloading or using the <strong>VidX Files</strong> app, these terms will automatically apply to you. Therefore, you should make sure you read them carefully before using the app. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of the app, any part of the app, or trademarks in any way. You are also not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you should not try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to <strong>Arti Mishra</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Use of the App</h2>
    <p>The <strong>VidX Files</strong> app is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without any warranties of any kind. You are responsible for how you use the app and for ensuring that it suits your needs.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions. You are bound by the terms of those third-party services when you use them through the app.</p>
    <p>Links to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" rel="noopener">Google Play Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics" rel="noopener">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" rel="noopener">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to the App</h2>
    <p><strong>Arti Mishra</strong> is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the app or its services without clearly making it known to you.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that <strong>Arti Mishra</strong> will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi‑Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but <strong>Arti Mishra</strong> cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi‑Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
    <p>If you are using the app outside of an area with Wi‑Fi, remember that your terms of agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app or other third‑party charges. In using the app, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming.</p>

    <h2>Liability</h2>
    <p>With respect to <strong>Arti Mishra’s</strong> responsibility for your use of the app, when you are using the app, it is important to bear in mind that although I endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, I do rely on third parties to provide information so that it can be made available to you. <strong>Arti Mishra</strong> accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p><strong>Arti Mishra</strong> may update the app from time to time. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems I decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. <strong>Arti Mishra</strong> does not promise that the app will always be updated so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>I may terminate or suspend access to the app immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>I may update the Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
